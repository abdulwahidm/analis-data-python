# Data Processing Considerations

## Introduction
This document discusses various considerations in data processing, including challenges in handling industry-specific data, biases in data, data credibility, privacy and ethics in data processing, and data security.

## Data Processing Challenges

### Industry-specific Challenges
- Academic datasets (e.g., iris, titanic) are commonly used for practice but may not represent the complexity of real industry data.
- Industry data is often complex and requires data cleaning before analysis.
- Business requirements are dynamic, influenced by market conditions, competitors, and macroeconomic factors.

### Challenges Faced by Data Practitioners
- Privacy and ethical concerns in data processing.
- Security considerations for data handling.
- Adherence to regulations governing data privacy and ethics.

## Bias in Data

### Definition
Bias is a prejudice or tendency supporting or opposing something unfairly, occurring intentionally or unintentionally.

### Types of Bias
1. **Sampling Bias:**
   - Occurs when the sample does not represent the entire population.
   - Mitigated using random sampling techniques.

2. **Observer Bias:**
   - Arises from individual tendencies during observation.
   - Avoided through repeated observations.

3. **Interpretation Bias:**
   - Results from interpreting ambiguous situations in binary terms.
   - Involving others for confirmation helps mitigate bias.

4. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - Arises from seeking or interpreting information to confirm pre-existing beliefs.
   - Practitioners should strive for neutrality in the analysis process.

## Data Credibility

### Criteria for Ensuring Data Quality
1. **Reliability:**
   - Data is reliable if it is accurate, complete, and unbiased.

2. **Originality:**
   - Original data and ownership are crucial for credibility.

3. **Comprehensiveness:**
   - Ensuring data has all necessary information to address business challenges.

4. **Data Timeliness:**
   - Using up-to-date data is essential for accurate analyses.

## Privacy and Ethics in Data Processing

### Data Ethics Principles
1. **Ownership:**
   - Data ownership belongs to individuals who generate the data.

2. **Transparency:**
   - All data processing stages and algorithms must be transparent.

3. **Consent:**
   - Explicit consent is required for data collection.

4. **Currency:**
   - Individuals must be aware of financial transaction details if data is used for such purposes.

5. **Privacy & Openness:**
   - Organizations are responsible for safeguarding private information during data processing.

### Regulations
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Ministerial Regulation No. 20/2016 on Personal Data Protection (PDP)

## Data Security

### Definition
Data security involves protecting digital information throughout processing, covering physical hardware, software, policies, and procedures.

### Security Methods
1. **Encryption:**
   - Utilizes algorithms to transform data into an unreadable format.

2. **Tokenization:**
   - Converts specific data elements into random tokens stored separately.
