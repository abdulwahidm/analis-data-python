# Introduction to Data Wrangling

## Congratulations!
Congratulations on completing the first half of your journey in the Learn Data Analysis with Python course. So far, you've learned a lot, starting from basic concepts in data analysis, descriptive statistics, to various considerations in data processing.

Now, let's delve into one of the early stages in the data analysis project lifecycle, which is data wrangling. Data wrangling is a process or a set of activities that includes data gathering, data assessment, and data cleaning before using it in the data analysis process [4].

## Data Wrangling Process

### Gathering Data
The data wrangling process begins with data gathering. In this stage, we collect all the data needed to address the business questions or challenges.

### Assessing Data
Once all required data is collected, the next step is assessing the data. This process is conducted to evaluate the quality and structure of the data. Additionally, it aims to identify various issues within the data, such as missing values, non-standard values, etc.

### Cleaning Data
If issues (e.g., missing values, outliers, etc.) are identified in the previous process, they need to be cleaned before entering the data analysis stage. There are several techniques available for data cleaning, and we'll cover them in future lessons.

Okay, that's a brief overview of the processes involved in the data wrangling stage. Similar to the stages in data analysis, the stages in data wrangling are also iterative. In the next lessons, we will explore each stage in depth.

So, are you ready to wrangle?
